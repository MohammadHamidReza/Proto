			<h2>Jagannath Temple</h2>
			<div class="row">
 
  <div class="col-sm-9">
			<p>	The Shree Jagannath Temple (Odia: ଶ୍ରୀ ଜଗନ୍ନାଥ ମନ୍ଦିର) of Puri is an important Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Jagannath, a form of lord Vishnu, located on the eastern coast of India, at Puri in the state of Odisha. The temple is an important pilgrimage destination The present temple was rebuilt from the 10th century onwards, on the site of an earlier temple, and begun by King Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva, first of the Eastern Ganga dynasty.[1]

The Puri temple is famous for its annual Ratha yatra, or chariot festival, in which the three principal deities are pulled on huge and elaborately decorated temple cars. These gave their name to the English term Juggernaut. Unlike the stone and metal icons found in most Hindu temples, the image of Jagannath is made of wood and is ceremoniously replaced every twelve or nineteen years by an exact replica.[2]

The temple is sacred to all Hindus and especially in those of the Vaishnava traditions. Many great saints, such as Ramananda & Ramanuja were closely associated with the temple. Ramanuja established the Emar Mutt near the temple and the Govardhan Mutt, which is the seat of one of the four Shankaracharyas. It is also of particular significance to the followers of the Gaudiya Vaishnavism whose founder Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, was attracted to the deity, Jagannath, and lived in Puri for many years.

		<p>Different theories variously characterize the shrine's patron deity Jagannatha as of tribal, Buddhist, Jain or Vaishnavite origin. Polish Indologist Olgierd M. Starza, who reviewed these different theories concluded that "several early theories regarding the origin of Jagannatha have been refuted; only the tribal theory remains a possibility."[5]

The present-day temple was built by the Ganga dynasty king Anantavarman Chodaganga in the 12th century CE, as suggested by the Kendupatna copper-plate inscription of his descendant Narasimhadeva II.[6] Anantavarman was originally a Shaivite, and became a Vaishnavite sometime after he conquered the Utkala region (in which the temple is located) in 1112 CE. A 1134-1135 CE inscription records his donation to the temple. Therefore, the temple construction must have started sometime after 1112 CE.[7]

According to a story in the temple chronicles, it was founded by Anangabhima-deva II: different chronicles variously mention the year of construction as 1196, 1197, 1205, 1216, or 1226.[8] This suggests that the temple's construction was completed or that the temple was renovated during the reign of Anantavarman's son Anangabhima.[9] The temple complex was further developed during the reigns of the subsequent kings, including those of the Ganga dynasty and the Suryvamshi (Gajapati) dynasty.

<h2>Snana Yatra</h2>
<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-4">
<img src="static/images/image11.jpg" class="img-responsive"></div>

			<div class="col-sm-8">
<p>The Snana Yatra (Odia: ସ୍ନାନ ଯାତ୍ରା) is a bathing festival celebrated on the Purnima (full moon day) of the Hindu month of Jyeshtha. It is an important festival of the Jagannath devotees. It is the birth day of lord Jagannath.This is the first occasion in the year as per the Hindu calendar, when the deities Jagannath, Balabhadra, Subhadra, Sudarshan, and Madanmohan are brought out from the Jagannath Temple (Puri) and taken in a procession to the Snana Bedi. There they are ceremonially bathed and decorated for a public audience with the devotees.
</p></div></div>
<h2>Ratha Yatra</h2>
<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-7">

<p>Ratha Yatra, also referred to as Rathayatra, Rathajatra or Chariot festival is any public procession in a chariot.[1][2] The term particularly refers to the annual Rathayatra in Odisha, Jharkhand, West Bengal and other East Indian states, particularly the Odia festival [3] that involve a public procession with a chariot with deities Jagannath (Vishnu avatar), Balabhadra (his brother), Subhadra (his sister) and Sudarshana Chakra (his weapon) on a ratha, a wooden deula-shaped chariot. It attracts over a million Hindu pilgrims who join the procession each year.[1][4]

Rathayatra processions have been historically common in Vishnu-related (Jagannath, Rama, Krishna) traditions in Hinduism across India,[5] in Shiva-related traditions,[6] saints and goddesses in Nepal,[7] with Tirthankaras in Jainism,[8] as well as tribal folk religions found in the eastern states of India.[9] Notable ratha yatras in India include the Ratha yatra of Puri, the Dhamrai Ratha Yatra and the Ratha Yatra of Mahesh. Hindu communities outside India, such as in Singapore, celebrate Rathayatra such as those associated with Jagannath, Krishna, Shiva and Mariamman.[10] According to Knut Jacobsen, a Rathayatra has religious origins and meaning, but the events have a major community heritage, social sharing and cultural significance to the organizers and participants

<h2>Sri Hari Sayan</h2>
<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
<p>This is the sayana utsav (sleeping ceremony) of the Lord. Sri Hari Sayan festival of Lord Jagannath is observed on the Asadha sukla edadashi (June–July).
</p></div></div>
<h2>Uttarayan</h2>
<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-10">
<p>
The Surya Siddhanta defines Uttarāyaṇa or Uttarayan as the period between the Makara Sankranti (which currently occurs around January 14) and Karka Sankranti (which currently occurs around July 16).[1][2] The term Uttarayana is derived from two different Sanskrit words "uttara" (North) and "ayana" (movement) thus indicating a semantic of the northward movement of the Earth on the celestial sphere. This movement begins to occur a day after the winter solstice in December which occurs around 22 December and continues for a six-month period through to the summer solstice around June 21 (dates vary ). This difference is because the solstices are continually precessing at a rate of 50 arcseconds / year due to the precession of the equinoxes, i.e. this difference is the difference between the sidereal and tropical zodiacs. The Surya Siddhanta bridges this difference by juxtaposing the four solstitial and equinotial points with four of the twelve boundaries of the rashis

		<p>Jagannatha is regarded as the supreme god and the sovereign monarch of the Odishan empire. The entire ritual pattern of Jagannatha has been conceived keeping such twin aspects in view. The ritual system of the temple is very elaborate and complex involving a multitude of functionaries above one thousand spread over one hundred categories. The rituals of Jagannatha can broadly be divided into three parts - the daily , the occasional and the festive. In Jagannatha temple these rituals assume the term 'niti'.</p>

Besides the pilgrims can go up to "Ratna Singhasana" at certain times paying a nominal fee Rs. 10/-, which is known as "Parimanik Darshana". At other times the pilgrims can have their darshan from a little distance that is in "Jagamohan" and "Vitarakatha". At the time of Beshalagi, one can have darshan near "Bhitar Katha" by buying a ticket of Rs. 1.50.</p>

	<h1 id="mah">Mahaprasada</h1>
<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-8">
		<p>According to the Skanda Purana, Lord Jagannath redeems the devotees by permitting them to partake his Mahaprasad,to have his darshan and worship Him by rituals and offering gifts.

Mahaprasad is treated here as 'Anna Brahma'. The temple kitchen has got the capacity to cook for a lakh of devotees on a day. Mahaprasad is cooked only in earthern pots and on hearths. The steam-cooked food is offered to Lord Jagannath first and then to Goddess Bimala after which it becomes Mahaprasad. This Mahaprasad is freely partaken by people of all castes and creeds without any discrimination. The items offered include cooked rice, dal, vegetable curry, sweet-dishes, cakes etc. Dry confectionaries are prepared of sugar, jaggery, wheat flour, ghee, milk etc. When the steam-cooked food is carried to Lord in slings of earthern pots no flavour comes up from the food but when the same is carried back to the sale point after being offered to the Lord a delicious smell spells along in the breeze to the pleasant surprise of the devotees. Now the food is blessed. Mahaprasad consolidates human bond, sanctifies sacraments and grooms the departing soul for its journey upwards. Mahaprasads are sold in Anand Bazar or the PleasureMart of the temple which is situated on the northeastern corner of the outer enclosure of the temple. Most of the residents in and around puri depend upon this Mahaprasad to entertain their guests during social functions such as thread ceremony and weddings.

The tourists prefer to carry a particular type of dry Mahaprasad known as" Khaja" (made of maida,sugar and ghee) which stays fresh for days together.<p>

		<p>Offerings and donations are the mainstay of the income of the Shrine Board. The donations offered by the pilgrims are utilized for the creation of infrastructural facilities for the visiting pilgrims as well as for general upkeep and maintenance of the Holy Shrine. The Board does not receive any significant financial assistance from the State or Central governments. Therefore, most of the facilities created for the benefit of the pilgrims have been created through the central pool of donations.
In addition to the central pool of donations (which is nothing but the sum total of all donations and offerings received in a year) there are also specific donation and poojan schemes in which devotees can participate directly. These have been formulated based on suggestions received from pilgrims and devotees from time to time. Most of these pertain to the creation of infrastructural and other facilities like Yatri Sarais, Shelter Sheds and other welfare activities. <p>
